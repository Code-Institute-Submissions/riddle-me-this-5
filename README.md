# Pratical Python Milestone Project

## Riddle-Me-This

A web application game that asks players to guess the answer to a pictorial or text-based riddle.
The player is presented with an image or text that contains the riddle. Players enter their answer into a textarea and submit their answer using a form.
If a player guesses correctly, they are redirected to the next riddle.
If a player guesses incorrectly, their incorrect guess is stored and printed below the riddle. The textarea is cleared so they can guess again.
Multiple players can play an instance of the game at the same time. Users are identified by a unique username.
Create a leaderboard that ranks top scores for all users.

## Bootstrap template used

As the main focus of this project is Python and the use of the Flask Framework, it was felt that there was no need to start the HTML & CSS from scratch
and so instead appropriate template files were imported to Cloud9 using the 'wget' command.

Folders that were not necessary were then deleted.

The template used is called Freelancer and is downloadable from https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/
